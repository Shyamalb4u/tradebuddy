                stipulate that:<br></br>
                <br></br>
                (a) Such Promotional Programs are entirely peripheral to, and
                not part of, the essential bargain or primary consideration for
                Your acquisition of our Signals;<br></br>
                <br></br>
                (b) No Promotional Program, past or present, constitutes a
                contractual right, entitlement, or vested interest, and any
                indication, whether verbal, written, graphical, or implied, of
                potential ROI percentages, referral rates, or payment schedules
                is illustrative only, non-binding, and subject to change without
                prior notice;<br></br>
                <br></br>(c) The Company retains the absolute, unqualified, and
                unilateral authority, exercisable at any time and from time to
                time, to amend, alter, revise, restructure, suspend, delay,
                reduce, or permanently discontinue any Promotional Program, in
                whole or in part, with immediate effect and without liability,
                explanation, or compensation of any kind to any User, regardless
                of past participation or historical payouts;<br></br>
                <br></br>(d) The computation, accrual, crediting, withholding,
                offsetting, payment, or forfeiture of any amount under any
                Promotional Program shall be determined exclusively by the
                Company, in such manner, method, and timing as the Company deems
                fit, and any determination made by the Company in such respect
                shall be final, binding, and conclusive, not subject to
                challenge, appeal, or review in any forum, whether judicial,
                arbitral, or otherwise;<br></br>
                <br></br>(e) No representation, whether explicit or implicit,
                made by the Company, its representatives, marketing materials,
                or other Users, shall be construed as a guarantee, assurance,
                warranty, or undertaking that You will receive any ROI, referral
                income, or other promotional benefit, and You acknowledge the
                possibility of receiving zero such benefits for any duration,
                including the entire period of Your use of the Services;
                <br></br>
                <br></br>(f) Participation in any Promotional Program does not
                modify, expand, or supersede the fundamental nature of the
                Services, and the sole guaranteed deliverable in exchange for
                Your payment is access to the Signals;<br></br>
                <br></br>(g) Any reliance on historical payout patterns, prior
                promotional benefits, or anecdotal results constitutes a
                voluntary assumption of risk by You and shall not form the basis
                of any claim, expectation, or legal proceeding against the
                Company;<br></br>
                <br></br>(h) You expressly waive, release, and forever discharge
                the Company from any and all claims, demands, causes of action,
                damages, costs, or liabilities, whether known or unknown,

                cessation, or performance of any Promotional Program;<br></br>
                <br></br>(i) The provisions of this Section shall survive the
                termination or expiration of these Terms and shall continue in
                full force and effect notwithstanding any cessation of Your use
                of the Services.<br></br>

                Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss and is
                not suitable for every investor. You should carefully consider

                before engaging in cryptocurrency trading or purchasing our
                Signals. You may lose part or all of Your investment, and You
                should not invest money that You cannot afford to lose. The

                in ROI or referral programs is undertaken entirely at Your own
